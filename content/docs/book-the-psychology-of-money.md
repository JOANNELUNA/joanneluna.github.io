### Summary

A short personal summary of *The Psychology of Money* by Morgan Housel.

### Key Ideas

- Compounding feels slow… until it doesn't.
- Behavior > raw intelligence in personal finance.
- Enough is a number you define; avoid moving goalposts.

#### Compounding in real life

Compounding works best when you leave things alone. Small, boring decisions repeated consistently beat heroic, one‑off efforts.

#### Luck & risk coexist

Outcomes are distributions, not destinies. Respect both luck and risk when telling stories about success or failure.

### Favorite Quotes

> “Money’s greatest intrinsic value—and this can’t be overstated—is its ability to give you control over your time.”

### My Actions

- Keep a higher cash buffer.
- Automate investments; avoid tinkering.
- Define “enough” explicitly.
